# Tree

This repo is mostly for me, but you are welcome to make suggestions. [inuitcss](https://twitter.com/inuitcss) is the project to fork.
I'm mostly catching up and learning as I go.


## Credits

Tree, although produced and maintained by one developer, could not have
been possible without inspiration from an array of other projects.

* **[inuitcss](https://twitter.com/inuitcss)** Powerful, scalable, Sass-based, BEM, OOCSS framework.
* **[suitcss](http://suitcss.github.io/)** Style tools for UI components.
* **[Sassaparilla](https://twitter.com/fff_sass)** A quick start template for (hopefully) better websites.
