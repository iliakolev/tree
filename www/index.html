            <h1>Definition</h1>

            <p>Although "tree" is a term of common parlance, there is no universally recognised
            precise definition what a tree is, neither botanically nor in common language.</p>

            <p>In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with the general form of an elongated
            stem, or trunk, which supports the photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance
            above the ground.</p>

            <p>Trees are also typically defined by height, with smaller plants being classified
            as shrubs,however the minimum height which defines a tree varies widely, from 10 m
            to 0.5 m. By these broadest definitions, large herbaceous plants such as papaya and
            bananas are trees, despite not being considered as trees under more rigorous definitions.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>Trees are an evolutionary adaptation to competition for space. By growing taller
            trees are able to compete better for sunlight. They have modified structures that
            allow them to grow much taller and spread out their foliage, such as thicker stems
            that are composed of specialized cells that add structural strength and durability.
            They are long-lived perennial plants that can increase their size each year by
            producing woody stems. They differ from shrubs, which are also woody plants, by
            usually growing larger and having a single main stem; but the distinction between
            a small tree and a large shrub is not always clear, made more confusing by the fact
            that trees may be reduced in size under harsher environmental conditions such as on
            mountains and subarctic areas. The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated
            classes of plants in response to similar environmental challenges, making it a
            classic example of parallel evolution. With an estimated 100,000 species, the
            number of trees worldwide might total twenty-five percent of all living plant
            species. Their greatest number grow in tropical regions and many of these areas
            have not yet been fully surveyed by botanists, making tree diversity and ranges
            poorly known.</p>
